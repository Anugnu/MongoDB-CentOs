Only on CentOs and RedHat

Note: Type commands from Root or use "Sudo" infront of most commands.
$ is not in root
# is in root

1)Open VI editor
- vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.6.repo (use sudo if its not root)

2)copy below details in vi editor.
right click on screen to copy, make sure you copied it correctly.
This is path for required repository.
press ESC button and then "i" for insert data. 

[mongodb-org-3.6]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/3.6/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.6.asc

3)Now press ESC button and then ":", then "wq!" to copy and quit from editor.

3)Before we move on, we should verify that the MongoDB repository exists within the yum utility.
The repolist command displays a list of enabled repositories:
- yum repolist (use sudo if its not root)

4)Now install MongoDB server into system.(use sudo if its not root)
- yum install -y mongodb-org  (this installs latest version)
incase if you are using fedora
dnf install mongodb

5)If you are using SElinux(secure edition), you have to edit its config
- vi /etc/selinux/config , make it disabled 

6)you have to start mongodb database server first (use sudo if its not root)
- systemctl start mongod
- systemctl restart mongod for restart
- systemctl stop mongod for stop
Incase you want mongodb to autostart on system boot
- chkconfig mongod on (or) systemctl enable mongod

7)Check the installation sucesseded:(use sudo if its not root)
- tail /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

8)check the version(use sudo if its not root)
- mongod --version

9)connect the mongodb commandline
- mongo

10)Sample commands to test MongoDB
> use mydb - will create and take you to "mydb" database.
>db.createCollection("nameit", {capped: false}) to create collection
> db.test.save({a:1}) - will create "test" container 
	in "mydb" database and adds value of a:1.
> db.test.find() - will show all the data in the "test" container.
> exit - for exit from db server.
> db.help() - any help required.

Other Useful things:

1)To check configurations of MongoDB
- go to /etc/mongod.conf
- uncomment the security section and add host addresses or 0.0.0.0 for access from any network,
	which will be commented out in default.

2)Adding database and users
- use database_name, will create database with that name.
 To create admin user, type below command with required/appropriate values.
- db.createUser({user: "my-admin", pwd: "password", roles:[{role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin"}]})
 To login into db as that user
- mongo -u my-admin -p --authenticationDatabase admin
 And before adding users, create a new database to store user data, so create a new database.
- use user-details for "user-details as a database.
 Just to give read/write role to a new user to multiple databases at a time
- db.createUser({user: "read-user", pwd: "password", roles:[{role: "read", db: "db_name"}, {role:"readWrite", db: "db_name"}]})
